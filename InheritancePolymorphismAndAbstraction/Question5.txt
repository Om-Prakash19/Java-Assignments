Q. Differentiate between method overloading and overriding .

Ans--> Method overloading :
* The process of extending the existing method functionality with new functionality is called method overloading.
* It is also called static polymorphism and compile time polymorphism.
*In this case different method parameters must be given.
*We can achieve it with or without inheriance.

Method overriding :
*The process of replacing the existing method functionality with new functionality is called method overriding.
*It is also called dynamic polymorphism and run time polymorphism.
*In this  case the same method parameters must be provieded.
*We can only achieve this through inheritance.
