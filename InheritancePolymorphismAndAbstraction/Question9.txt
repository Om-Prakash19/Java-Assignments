Q. Differentiate between abstraction and encapsulation .

Ans--> Abstraction : 
When we don't want to give the body of a method then we declare it with "abstract" keyword.This process is called abstraction.class should also be declared with abstract keyword.

Encapsulation : Encapsulation is the combination of data hiding and abstraction.
    Encapsulation = data hiding + abstraction
Data hiding means not exposing our data directly to the real world.
