Q. What  is the difference between abstract method and final method in java ?  explain.

Ans. Abstract method :
* Abstract method is a method which is declared using "abstract" keyword.
*Abstract method is used where we don't want to give body to a method.
*Abstract method's body should be compulsorily given in child class.

Final Method :
* Final method is declared using "final" keyword.
* Final method is used when we don't want to override the method in the subclass.
*Final method can't be overriden in the child class.
