Question--> what do you mean by mutable and immutable object ?

Ans : Mutable Objects: mutable objects are created when we define a mutable string.It's value can be changed and is stored in the same object.

Immutable object : immutable objects are created when  we difen an immutable string.It's value can't be changed as if we do changes in string a new object will be created.
