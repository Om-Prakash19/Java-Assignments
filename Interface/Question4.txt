Question --> What is the diference between abstract class and interface in java ?

Answer --> Differences between abstract classes and interface in Java : 

Interfaces : 

1. Interfaces are used when we want 100% abstraction or we don't know the implementation of methods.
2.In interface methods are by default declared public and abstract.
3.We can't use other access modifiers in methods like private,protected,static,final,etc.
4.In interfaces variables are by default declared public static final.
5.We can't use other access modifiers in variables like private,protected,abstract,etc.


Abstract classes : 

1.Abstract class is used when we want abstraction between 0-100 % or we partially know the implementation of methods.
2.In abstract class there is no by deafult declaration of methods.
3.There is no restriction in the use of access modifiers in abstract class in methods.
4.In abstract class there is no by default decalaration of variables.
5.We can use access modifiers for variables in abstract class as there is no restriction.
