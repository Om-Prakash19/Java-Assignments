Q. What is default constructor ? Explain with an example.

Ans--> Default constructor is a constructor which is automatically generated by the compiler if we do not write any constructor by our own.
It's access modifier is same as that of a class(public,private,protected,default). 

Eg.
class Demo{
    ----
    ----
}

for this compiler will generate:

class Demo{
    Demo(){
        super();
    }
    ---
    ---
}
