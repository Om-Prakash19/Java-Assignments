Q. How is No-argument constructor different from a default Constructor ?

Ans--> No-argumentb constructor : No-args is a constructor which is written by a programmer which do not contain any arguments(inputs) in it.

default-Constructor : default constructor is a constructor which is automatically generated by the compiler if we do not write any constructor by our own.
It's access modifier is same as that of a class(public,private,protected,default).
