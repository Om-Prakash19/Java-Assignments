Question --> What is Difference bet1een Externalizable and Serializable interface ?

Answer : Differences between Serializable and Externalizable interface : 

Serializable :
->It is meant for default serialization.
->Here everything is taken care by JVM and programmer do not have any control.
->Here only the total object will be saved. It is not possible to save part of the object.
->Serializable is best choice if we want to save total object to the file.
->Realatively performance is low.
->Serializable interface do not contain any method. So it is a marker interface.
-> Serializable class do not require to contain any public no-arg contructor.

Externalizable :
->It is meant for customized serialization.
->Here everything is taken care by programmer and JVM do not have any control.
->Here not only we can save total object but part of a object can also be saved.
->Serializable is best choice if we want to save part of object to the file.
->Realatively performance is high.
->Serializable interface contain two methods. So it is not a marker interface.
-> Serializable class do require to contain any public no-arg contructor. In absence of no-arg constructor we will get RunTimeException saying "InvalidClassException".
