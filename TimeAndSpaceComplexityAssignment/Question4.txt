Question 4: Given a recurrence relation: 
T(n) = 16*T(n/4) + (n^2)*logn 
Find the time complexity of this relation using the master theorem. 

Solution: 
Given : T(n) = 16*T(n/4) + (n^2)*logn 

Required form for master's theorem = a*T(n/b) + O((n^k)*(logn^p))

Now value are a = 16 , b = 4 , k = 2 and  p = 1

Now a = 16 and b^k = 16
so a = b^k so it is the 2nd case

now p>-1 so
T(n) = O((n^(logba))*((logn^)^(p+1)))

Now putting value we get T(n) = O((n*logn)^2) Answer
