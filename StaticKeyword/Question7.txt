Q. Difference between static and instance variables.

Ans--> Static variables : 
        -> This variables can be called directly by class name and we don't have to create an object to call it.
        -> We declare this variable using this keyword.
        -> The memory for static variables is allocated in method area.

    Instance variables :
        -> If we want to call or access this variables then we have to create an object for it.
        -> We don't need any keyword to declare it.
        -> The memory for instance variable is allocated in heap area.
